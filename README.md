# Ease-of-Business-Index
There are various economic features that affect the business ecosystem. But we need to identify those features among the entire feature space that impact the ease of doing or starting the business in the given economic region (here states and Union Territories of the union of India). For this purpose we have used various quantitative feature extraction statistical tools like Correlation Analysis and Cluster Analysis. We have tried to identify and understand these unique features and also understand what makes one State better than the other in terms of doing business. Further we have also justified the importance of selected features and then discussed their impact in the business ecosystem.
After we have formulated our final feature set, we carried the process of Normalization and other preprocessing technique to prepare our data for final analysis.
We used three different methodologies for devising an evaluation metric that will represent our ease of doing business numerically. And after comparing those three different methodologies with each other and also with RBI score, we finalized one of those metric as our “Ease of Doing Business Index.”

We carried out the process of Feature Selection using some of the best quantitative models. These tools will help us in extracting important and independent features or factors. The two quantitative techniques we used are:
• Correlation Analysis
• Cluster Analysis

Devising Evaluation Metric
After feature selection, preprocessing and cleaning the dataset our next and final step is to devise an evaluation metric that represents the ease of doing business numerically upon which our scoring will be based on. And on the basis of the scoring we will be finally able to rank the state .
This metric will be our ease of doing business index.
